  """
  An HTTP Session is the external API to the communication link
  between client and server.

  Every request is executed as part of a HTTP Session.
  An HTTP Session lives as long as the underlying TCP connection and receives
  request data from it and writes response data to it.

  Receiving data and parsing this data into [HTTPRequest](http-HTTPRequest.md)s is happening on
  the TCPConnection actor. The [HTTPSession](http-HTTPSession.md) actor is started when a new TCPConnection
  is accepted, and shut down, when the connection is closed.

  ### Receiving a Request

  As part of the Request-Response handling internal to this HTTP library,
  a HTTPSession is instantiated that forwards requests to a [HTTPHandler](http-HTTPHandler.md),
  to actual application code, which in turn sends Responses back to the HTTPSession instance
  it was instantiated with (See [HTTPHandlerFactory](http-HTTPHandlerFactory.md).

  See [HTTPHandler](http-HTTPHandler.md) on how requests are received by application code.

    Start receiving a request.

    [HTTPRequest](http-HTTPRequest.md) contains all information extracted from
    these parts.

    The [RequestID](http-RequestID.md) is passed in order for the HTTPSession
    implementation to maintain the correct request order in case of HTTP pipelining.
    Response handling can happen asynchronously at arbitrary times, so the RequestID
    helps us to get the responses back into the right order, no matter how they
    are received from the application.

    * HTTPSession.send_start    - exactly once    - submit status and headers
    * HTTPSession.send_chunk    - 0 or more times - submit body
    * HTTPSession.send_finished - exactly once    - clean up resources

  // optimized raw api
  be send_raw(raw: ByteSeqIter, request_id: RequestID) =>
    """
    ### Optimized raw API

    Send raw bytes to the HTTPSession in form of a [ByteSeqIter](builtin-ByteSeqIter.md).

    These bytes may or may not include the response body.
    You can use `HTTPSession.send_chunk()` to send the response body piece by piece.

    To finish sending the response, it is required to call `HTTPSession.send_finished()`
    to wrap things up, otherwise the server might misbehave.

    This API uses the [TCPConnection.writev](net-TCPConnection.md#writev) method to
    optimize putting the given bytes out to the wire.

    To make this optimized path more usable, this library provides the [ResponseBuilder](http-ResponseBuilder.md),
    which builds up a response into a [ByteSeqIter](builtin-ByteSeqIter.md), thus taylored towards
    being used with this API.

    Example:

    ```pony
    class MyHTTPHandler is HTTPHandler
      let _session: HTTPSession

      new create(session: HTTPSession) =>
        _session = session

      fun ref apply(request: HTTPRequest val, request_id: RequestID): Any =>
