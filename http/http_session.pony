  """
  An HTTP Session is the external API to the communication link
  between client and server. A session can only transfer one message
  at a time in each direction. The client and server each have their
  own ways of implementing this interface, but to application code (either
  in the client or in the server 'back end') this interface provides a
  common view of how information is passed *into* the `http` package.
